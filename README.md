This project is a challenge by frontend mentor.
I used pure HTML and CSS in designing it 
It consist of one overall parent content div where all the child contents are placced inside
Css grid was basically the tool I used in making the layout, and it was pretty quite easy
It's a challenge for beginners and frontend developers who has left coding for a long while...
